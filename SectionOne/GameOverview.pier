! Game Overview

We're going to write a new game for Pharo. The following ideas should be represented in our game.

The game will be played on a grid. We will imagine to have a laser beam that can be activated by the user. It will fire inside this grid from a specific location. The laser beam will always fire from the bottom edge underneath the first column of cells. As the laser beam traverses inside our grid it can hit deflecting mirrors. These mirrors will divert the laser beam's direction as it travels. Ultimately the beam should hit a target location inside our grid.
